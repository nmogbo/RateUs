All of a sudden my iPhone 7 S plus won't work anymore. The Apple employees are useless and incompetent and make excuses. They do not explain anything. Say that the phone has just stopped working with no fault to the user but Apple takes zero accountability or responsibility. I'm not surprised & I know it ultimately doesn't matter to the company but we will never purchase another Apple product and will advocate for people to not support you or your products.
