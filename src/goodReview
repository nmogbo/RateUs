I can list a few really great experiences with apple. One that comes to mind is when the battery of my iPad Pro, that I purchased 3 years ago, could no longer maintain a charge. The warranty was expired and I made the appointment. They charged me $99 and gave me a brand new iPad Pro. I was thrilled. Always pleasant and usually knowledgeable staff. Great products. I am an apple fan. All the way.
